# Example of JAT use for a region with multiple transects

Before starting create the output folders that are included in the jarkus.yml file and make sure that all directories have been filled correctly.
Also include the right directory for the jarkus.yml file in JAT_use_single_transect.py.

Then open JAT_use_region_transects.py in the python IDE of your choice (I use Spyder) and run the commands step by step. This should show you the steps necessary to extract the characteristic parameters for several transects and gives examples how these data can be visualized.
